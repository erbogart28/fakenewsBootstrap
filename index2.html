				<p class="lead">For hamburger aficionados who want the smell even when they can't get a bite, Burger King is putting the scent into a limited-edition fragrance.</p>

                <p class="lead">Burger King said Friday that the Whopper grilled beef burger-scented cologne will be sold only on April 1, and only in Japan. Sounds too good to be true? It's not an April Fools' Day joke, though the company chose the date deliberately.</p>
                
            	<p class="lead">The limited "Flame Grilled" fragrance can be purchased at 5,000 yen (about $40), including the burger. There will be only 1,000 of them.</p>

            	<p class="lead">Burger King said it hopes the scent would also seduce new grill-beef burger fans.</p>

				<p class="lead">Success is sweet, but can a sweet predict success? Or will this gambler get his just desserts?</p>

				<p class="lead">A college lecturer in Andover, United Kingdom, reportedly saw what he believed to be the face of golfer Rory McIlroy on a cheese Danish and bet $1,700 on him to win the Masters. "It’s got to be a sign -- Rory’s face on a piece of food from his girlfriend’s home country," Rob Price told British news site The Independent. "My mates had a giggle and think I’m mad, but if I pocket [$20,000], I’ll be the one laughing." Prior to the tournement Price tweeted news of his wager and posted a picture of confection.</p>

			 	<p class="lead">In the end nothing could be cruller: McIlroy finished eighth at the Masters and Price was toast. His girlfriend ventured there were several things $1,700 might better have been spent on than an ill-considered pastry play.</p>

            	<h3>By: Borden Drousy</h3>

            	<p class="lead">Eureka! After about a century of research, Swiss scientists have finally cracked the mystery of the holes in Swiss cheese.</p>

                <p class="lead">Despite what you may have been told as a child, they are not caused by mice nibbling away inside cheese wheels. Experts from Agroscope, a Swiss centre for agricultural research, say the phenomenon -- which marks famous Swiss cheeses such as Emmental and Appenzell -- is caused by tiny bits of hay present in the milk and not bacteria as previously thought.</p>

                <p class="lead">They found that the mystery holes in such cheeses became smaller or disappeared when milk used for cheese-making was extracted using modern methods. "It's the disappearance of the traditional bucket" used during milking that caused the difference, said Agroscope spokesman I.M. Shirley Wright, adding that bits of hay fell into it and then eventually cause the holes.</p>

            	<p class="lead">Police in rural northeastern Germany rushed out to track down a reported mob of up to 15 people armed with knives and sticks. Instead, they found a group of asparagus harvesters.</p>

                <p class="lead">Police in the town of Ludwigslust said a man called their emergency number Saturday to report having seen "10 to 15 people armed with knives and sticks" on a local road. Within minutes, six police cars were on their way to the scene. Officers quickly discovered, however, that the group was asparagus harvesters walking along the road with their work tools as they went to take a lunch break.</p>

                <p class="lead">White asparagus is a popular delicacy in Germany and a ubiquitous sight on restaurant menus in late spring.</p>
