        <p class="lead">Police say a belligerent man dressed in scuba gear caused a stir at a Traverse City, Michigan McDonalds restaurant when he waddled up to the drive-thru window and tried to order a filet-o-fish sandwich.</p>         
        <p class="lead">The Traverse City Record-Eagle reports when man, who had been drinking like a marlin, showed up Tuesday morning workers called police. Officers found the 48-year-old man a quarter mile down the pike flipping off passing drivers. Captain Crook of the Traverse City PD says the man was tanked. He was not arrested, but warned not to surface again at the restaurant.</p>
        <p class="lead">Crook couldn't fathom why the man was wearing scuba gear.</p>

        <h2>Toe Wrestling Competitors Put Best Foot Forward </h2>

        <h3>By: Susan Sochs</h3>
        <p class="lead">Draped in a Union Jack flag, Alan "Big Piggy" Nash retained his title last weekend as World Toe Wrestling Champion. The Derbyshire village of Boughringtown in northern England hosted the World Championship of Toe Wrestling last weekend in a competition that drew spectators of all ages for some serious toe-tussling.</p>
        <p class="lead">Toe wrestling traces its roots to 1976 when Staffordshire pub landlord George Burgess sought to find a new sport for Brits to dominate, according to the Bentley Brook Inn where the championship took place. "I just love the fact that this is the one sport that England always win at, we get hammered at everything else," Nash said. "My technique ... is to hurt the first person that comes into the ring with me: hurt them bad and terrify everyone else."</p>
        <p class="lead">There are two participants in each bout. With their feet on a small square ring on the floor, the competitors begin by locking their big toes together, before battling arm-wrestling style to drive their opponent's foot to the ground. Toe inspections are a must and mixed sex matches are, of course, not allowed.</p>
        <p class="lead">There have been some dirty toed tactics, 'flicking off' is one of them, organiser Edward Allington said. "If you know you're going to lose, if you pull your toe away then it's difficult for the referee to decide if it's accidental or deliberate."</p>

        <h2>Man Convicted of Driving Zamboni Drunk at Hockey Game</h2>

        <img class="thumbnail img-responsive img-rounded" alt="Drunken mugshot" title="Mugshot" src="http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2099914!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/fargo2n-2-web.jpg">

        <h3>By: I. C. Ice</h3>
        <p class="lead">A Fargo man who admitted being drunk while operating a Zamboni during a high school hockey game was convicted Tuesday after the judge rejected his lawyer's argument that the ice-resurfacing machine didn't meet the definition of a vehicle under city code.</p>
        <p class="lead">Lewis Cannon, 27, was sentenced to nine days in jail, with credit for one day served, and ordered a $1,500 fine, chemical dependency evaluation, and participation in the state's 24/7 sobriety program.</p>
        <p class="lead">He was arrested in January during a girls hockey game after witnesses complained he was driving erratically on the ice between periods and crashing into the boards. Police say his blood-alcohol content was nearly four times the legal limit for driving a motor vehicle.</p>
        <p class="lead">Defense attorney Sue Furst said during the bench trial Tuesday that the law is not clear whether a Zamboni is considered a vehicle, or whether it is illegal to drive the machine on the ice while drunk. But Municipal Court Judge Xavier Breath said state law is written to include vehicles "such as" a Zamboni.</p>
        <p class="lead">Afterward, Furst said her research of DUI law found specific vehicles such as tractors, snowmobiles, recreational vehicles and boats, but she found no references to a Zamboni.</p>
        <p class="lead">Cannon, who declined to comment after the hearing, apologized to the court and said he has been sober since the incident. "I feel I have been going around in circles, now I just want to start the next period of my life," he said.</p>

        <h2>Flooded Streams in New Jersey Cause Fish to Swim on Roads</h2>

        <p class="lead">New Jersey officials smell something fishy. There have been some incredible animal rescues from the elements, but the City of Newark's Department of Health and Community Wellness warned New Jerseyans today not to catch or eat fish that may have scavanged after the recent storms. </p>
        <p class="lead">In Newark, heavy rain and flooding has caused fish to swim out of overflown rivers. Some locals are placing them back to their homes while others see this as an opportunity for dinner.</p>
        <p class="lead">Department of Health spokeswoman Elle R. Highwater told reporters, "Hey. These are New Jersey rivers. Would you drink the water out of these rivers? If not, why would you eat fish that drink that water?"</p>
